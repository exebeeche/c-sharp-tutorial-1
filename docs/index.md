# Overview

In this tutorial, you create a game with bouncing balls.
The tutorial includes five articles explaining how to build the game 
step-by-step.

## The game concept

The game consists of two panels with bouncing balls and control elements. 
Balls move within the boundaries of each panel at a specified speed.
The control elements do the following:

- control speed of the balls
- display the number of collisions
- show full statistics on the balls

When you finish, you have a complete game.

## What you learn

Use all steps of this tutorial to learn about the following tasks in the 
Visual Studio Integrated Design Environment (IDE).

- Store objects, such as balls,
in a [List<T>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1) object.
- Use a `foreach` method to iterate through items in a list.
- Keep track of ball collisions by using an [event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/event) action.
- Make a timer that activates the balls.

## Prerequisites

The Visual Studio Integrated Design Environment (IDE) provides the tools you 
need to create the app.
